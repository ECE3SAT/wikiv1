                    <p>The ADCS mission is to get access to sensors for attitude determination and then apply correction through
                        actuators. </p>
                    <p>We designed our decision taking algorithm to be as it follows : </p>

                    </div>
                    <p>As we can see our algorithm begins with the initialization of our module (the IO, communication, sensors
                        and actuators).Then a confirmation of well-functioning is sent to the <a href="ECE3SAT/wiki/obc/index.html">OBC</a>.
                    </p>
                    <p>That’s where we reach the central loop. The <a href="ECE3SAT/wiki/obc/index.html">OBC</a> can give us
                        several order which can be classified as follow: </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <p>If it asks us to start to take measure or to move (so to start the actuators), we check if a
                                session in not already in progress and if it is not we perform the task and send the data.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>If it asks us to stop measures or movement, we check if we were doing it and if it is the case,
                                we stop doing it.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>Finally, if the <a href="ECE3SAT/wiki/obc/index.html">OBC</a> ask to shutdown, we verify if we
                                were performing action and then stop them. This put us to the end of our loop. </p>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4>BDOT Stabilization</h4>
                    <p>The goal is there to decrease the kinetic energy of the system, that’s to say stabilize the satellite.</p>
                    <p>In order to do that we need to use the properties of our actuators: when the magnetorquers are supplied correctly, they can generate a torque of equation T= m ^ B (m being the magnetic moment of the dipole and B the earth magnetic field). That means the satellite, which is totally linked with them will have the tendancy to align itself with the Earth magnetic field.
                    The principle is the following : </p>
                    <p>The torque created by the coils is calculated by : T = iS n ^ B </p>
                    <p>With I the intensity of current in A, S the surface of a spire in m², n the normal vector to this surface and B the magetic field (here earth).</p>
                    <p>In our case every element here are fixed except the intensity so using a positive or negative intensity will determine the rotation direction. We can also see that the torque being the result of a cross product, the magnetic moment will only create a torque if he is coplanar to the B vector (at least one component of it).</p>
                    <div class="v1-col v1-image v1-center v1-padding-large">
                        <img src="/wiki/images/ADCS-BDOT-illustration.png" width="500" height="350" onclick="onClick(this)" class=" v1-image v1-hover-opacity"
                            alt="BDOT illustration">
                        <figcaption>Figure 1: BDOT illustration</figcaption>
                    </div>
                    <p>The Bdot algorithm itself work as follow : when the satellite is moving so that the Y axis is moving toward the earth magnetic field, the temporal derivative of B will be positive. We use our magnetorquers to generate a torque opposed to the rotation (negative intensity here to have a magnetic moment oriented toward Y-).  We then reverse the dipole orientation (so I positive) when Y passes B, that is to say B° negative.</p>
                    <p>To sum up the way the Bdot algorithm work:</p>
                    <div class="v1-col v1-image v1-center v1-padding-large">
                        <img src="/wiki/images/ADCS-BDOT-algorithm.png" width="500" height="350" onclick="onClick(this)" class=" v1-image v1-hover-opacity"
                            alt="BDOT algorithm">
                        <figcaption>Figure 2: BDOT algorithm</figcaption>
                    </div>
                    <p>So The control law applies a magnetic dipole in the opposite direction to the change in the magnetic field (estimated with magnetometers data). The magnetorquers applies a torque following this equation:</p>
                    <p>Mi = -ki B’i  (with i being one of the three axis and B’ the temporal derivative of the B field)</p>
                    <p>As we can see the BDOT algorithm is a simple stabilization algorithm, only knowing the evolution of the magnetic field allow us to take the right decision to stop the rotation of our Cubesat.</p>
